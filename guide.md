### Musical Instruments
You are never actually too old to learn to play an instrument you have always liked. It is a perfect break from your laptop's screen.

#### Guitar
You will get surprised from how easily you can produce nice sounds. All you need to begin is:
* a [tuning app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovelin.guitartuna&hl=en&gl=US)
* a set of strings
* a footstool (recommended for classical guitar)
* and of course the guitar

You can either teach yourself with a huge collection of online tutorials and tabs or find a teacher and have online lessons. You can check out [Kurt Berg's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSmaT73sJrjOmf6PHjxVAQ) YouTube channel for easy beginner tutorials. [Sky Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDlfXUX_wYgyfiXbfQh96Eg) also has a good deal of classical guitar tutorials for different levels.

There are 3 major guitar types:

* *Nylon acoustic (classical):* It produces a mellow sound and it's ideal for beginners, as the strings are easy to pick and it is lightweight and cheap. However, it has wider fretboard.
* *Steel string acoustic:* The strings produce a brighter tone and they are ideal for strumming. However, building calluses can be really painful for beginners.
* *Electric:* You will need at least an amp as the sound is produced from electric signals. It also uses steel strings and it is a bit heavier. Nonetheless, it is great for creativity with many technics and effects.

#### Piano

While there is no doubt that having a good traditional teacher can be helpful, the fact is you can teach yourself how to play piano/keyboard very effectively by attending online piano lessons or watching online guides. You can check out [MangoldProject's Piano Lessons for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=827jmswqnEA&list=PLP9cbwDiLzdL6IS4-rmzR42ghq3T56XnK), which is a helpful step by step guide for leaning to play on a keyboard.

You can also write down your to-dos and organize your schedule and notes. It is best that you stay organized in order to achieve high productivity!

## <a name="writing"></a> Writing
Writing is a skill that I consider to be underestimated. Written communication is everywhere around us; in emails, articles or even in remote work where slack messages are the default form of communication.
There are many types of content produced by writing, like for example:
- Novels
- Short stories
- Academic papers
- Personal journals
- Technology documentations
- Blog posts
- And the list goes on

Writing is most often a solitary activity, except for people who like to write in cafe's. The ongoing lockdown is a great opportunity to start practicing writing. I will kick it off with one important tip that I've found to be helpful whenever I'm writing something for other people to read.

__Editing__ and __Writing__ are not the same thing. Whenever you write something, leave it for a few hours or maybe a few days. And then come back to it as an __editor__ to find ways to make it more captivating and understandable for the readers.

## <a name="past"></a>Take a look at the past
Quarantine days are a great opportunity for you to make a little stop in your life and look back. How did you get here? What people have you met along the way? What are the greatest stories that your life consists of so far?

What a better way to do that than to gather with your family or close friends and spend an evening looking at photos and videos of the past. Spark storytellings of fogotten adventures, funny circumstances, emotional moments and all the stuff that bond you together. You will be surprised by all the little important details of memories that you have forgotten!

### Ways to reflect on the past
* Search old albums and photos with your parents. Ask them for a backstory for each of them and find interesting things about them!
* Find old video tapes and watch old videos of you and your family. For example, you could watch yourself as a baby making your first steps!
* Open newer photos and videos stored in your computer or your phone. We might have forgotten some memories stored there.
* Search all the shared photos between you and a friend on the Messenger app. You can see how [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/566167593908940).
